  <h1 class="display-4">Welcome to our survey</h1>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-3">
      In this survey you will be presented with 5 different groups each with 4 to 8 people. Your task is to create a list of 10 recommended movies for each of these groups based on their preferences. The users' preferences are given as a top 10 list of movies for each user in the group. An example of 2 users can be seen in the picture on the right.<br>
      You create the list by dragging movies from an available list of all the movies appearing amongst the preferences to an empty list and arranging them by what you think the group would like to see the most. It is possible to reorder the list of movies you select by dragging them up or down.<br>
      The survey is not mobile friendly, as it is our experience that the drag and drop functionality does not work with mobile touchscreens.<br>
      We thank you for your participation, the button below will take you to the survey.<br>
